# Introduction
This project focuses on the development of an intelligent automatic irrigation system utilizing IoT technology. Such a system aids human resources in improving crop yields, plant fertility, and water use efficiency. The idea for developing this automated irrigation system is driven by the need to enhance water use efficiency in agriculture, addressing the growing issue of water resource scarcity in various regions.

In this journal, the components used include an Arduino UNO (ATMEGA328) microcontroller, power supply, water level monitor sensor, moisture sensor, water flow sensor, temperature sensor, ESP8266-WiFi Module, LCD Display, Buzzer, Relay, and DC Pump. The integration of technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, and machine learning can significantly contribute to the development of smart farming systems, thereby aiding human resources in boosting crop yields, enhancing plant fertility, and optimizing water use efficiency.

# Features
- Smart Irrigation: Automates watering based on soil moisture levels to ensure optimal plant health and water conservation.
- IoT Integration: Uses the ESP8266-WiFi Module to connect to the internet for remote monitoring and control.
- Comprehensive Monitoring: Includes sensors for water level, soil moisture, water flow, and temperature to provide a holistic view of the irrigation system.
- User Interface: Equipped with an LCD Display for real-time data presentation and a Buzzer for alerts.
- Efficient Resource Use: Aims to reduce water waste and improve the efficiency of water use in agriculture.
