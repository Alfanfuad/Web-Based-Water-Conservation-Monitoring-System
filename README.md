## Introduction
This project focuses on the development of an intelligent automatic irrigation system utilizing IoT technology. Such a system aids human resources in improving crop yields, plant fertility, and water use efficiency. The idea for developing this automated irrigation system is driven by the need to enhance water use efficiency in agriculture, addressing the growing issue of water resource scarcity in various regions.

In this journal, the components used include an Arduino UNO (ATMEGA328) microcontroller, power supply, water level monitor sensor, moisture sensor, water flow sensor, temperature sensor, ESP8266-WiFi Module, LCD Display, Buzzer, Relay, and DC Pump. The integration of technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, and machine learning can significantly contribute to the development of smart farming systems, thereby aiding human resources in boosting crop yields, enhancing plant fertility, and optimizing water use efficiency.

## Features
